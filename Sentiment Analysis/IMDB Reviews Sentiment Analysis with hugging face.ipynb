    "## Introduction to Transformers\n",
    "Sentiment Analysis is a type of problem in Natural Language Processing that involves determining whether a text has a positive or negative sentiment. This task is not as easy as one might think, because language is by definition very intricate and complex. This is accentuated even more in this types of datasets where we want to value sentiment based on a free-text review, as the user can write whatever he decides in it. Historically, this was a problem that used to be solved by making a sort of educated count of positive words vs negative words to quantify the overall sentiment of the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "As yo may imagine, this can get complex really fast. Let's think of an example like the following review: \"The movie was very good\". We would hope that our model is able to classify this as positive, as this is in fact a positive review. But now, let's think of another example like: \"The movie was not very good\". This time, the word \"not\" is negating the \"positiveness\" of the word very good, and so it's not easy for a model to understand this intricacies if it is just counting positive or negative sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next type of models we tried were Recurrent Neural Networks. This models try to understand the sequential relationship between words in a sentence by basically building a network that considers the results of the previous tokens or words for predicting the next one. This results in more powerful networks as language is by definition sequential. This concept of sequential is what we generally call context. Using this networks (particularly RNNs and LSTMs), language models got much more sophisticated as we were able to make predictions based on what previous words appeared in the sentence. But this had a problem, and that is that context is bidirectional in nature. This means that we may be referring to a token that comes after the token, not just before. And these models tend to fail in cases were context is more related to words that follow the word we are passing to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "So a few year back, a new player came to town, and it revolutionized the world of Deep Learning, first in the field of NLP, but it has now diversified and they can be seen everywhere, and the are called Transformers. Using a mechanism called self-attention and bidirectionality, the first transformers were able to introduce context to sentences in both directions, while simultaneously understanding which tokens were relevant to the meaning of the sentence. Using huge datasets, these transformer based models have taken over the world of NLP. Today, we are going to be using a very particular type of model pre-trained for sentiment analysis to try to infer the sentiment of a given movie review."

    "## Introduction to the HuggingFace transformers library\n",
    "The transformers library by HugginFace ðŸ¤— allows us to access these pre-trained transformer models for free! These models can then be fine-tuned to perform a specific task we want to do with them. Even better than that, HuggingFace already offers a set of transformer models that have been fine-tuned to perform different tasks. If you want to know more about the different fine-tuned models huggingface offers, visit this link. For this exercise we will be using the sentiment-analysis model offered in the pipeline class.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to install the transformers library in the kernel (or in your local coputer, if you are running this process locally. Then we will simply import the \"pipeline\" class from the transformers library, together with some extra libraries that will be useful to read the data and calculate the model accuracy."

    "In the end, we get a model that predicts 89% of the reviews correctly, and with no training at all! This models by HuggingFace are very good off-the-shelf tools, and can work really good even if you decide not to fin-tune them. If you have a sentiment analysis task and you don't have the time or the technical knowledge to re-train this model on your data, you can try this approach and see for yourself that the results can be really good!"
